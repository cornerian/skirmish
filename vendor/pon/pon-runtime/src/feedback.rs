//! Phase-B/D feedback cells shared by tier-0 helpers and later tier-1 codegen.
//!
//! The runtime records only hints here.  A racy or stale read may choose a bad
//! speculation, but guards in generated code remain the source of truth, so the
//! worst outcome is a side exit rather than incorrect Python semantics.
//!
//! # J0.3 inline-cache substrate
//!
//! Beyond arithmetic operand profiling, each cell can hold one inline-cache
//! record: an attribute load ([`AttrIC`]), a global/builtin load
//! ([`GlobalIC`]), or a call site ([`CallIC`]).  Which interpretation applies
//! is decided STATICALLY: lowering reserves one feedback slot per
//! specializable operation, and the operation fixes the cell kind
//! ([`FeedbackKind`]) — no kind bits are stored in the cell at runtime.
//!
//! Layout and concurrency contracts are pinned in
//! `plans/pon-pin-J03-inline-caches.md`.  Tier-1 codegen emits raw loads
//! against the `FEEDBACK_CELL_*_OFFSET` constants below; the cell size and
//! field offsets are frozen by compile-time assertions.
