# Three levels of "does this match Melee", and what each does not prove

Skirmish's test suite makes three distinct claims about agreement with the
original game. They are easy to conflate because all three involve comparing
Rust output against something external; keeping them separate matters because
each one only rules out a specific kind of bug.

## 1. Function-level C-oracle equivalence

`tests/*_differential.rs` (run with `cargo test --features c-oracle`) compile
small, content-hashed snapshots of the pinned decomp's own C (`tests/oracle`)
and compare a Rust function's output against that compiled C, bit for bit,
over generated and boundary inputs.

**Proves:** a specific Rust function reproduces a specific original C
function's arithmetic, including edge cases (NaN, signed zero, boundary
thresholds), given the same inputs.

**Does not prove:** that the function is called correctly, in the right order,
with the right inputs, as part of a whole action or frame; that unported
neighboring logic doesn't change the outcome; or anything about PowerPC/GameCube
floating-point behavior beyond what host C shares with it. See `AGENTS.md`:
"Host C agreement does not establish PowerPC or whole-game equivalence."

## 2. Self-recorded replay regression

`crates/cli/tests/replay_match.rs`, `crates/peppi-adapter/tests/replays.rs`
and `crates/cli/tests/slippi_corpus.rs` write synthetic `.slp` files (or use
[ten archived real files](../tests/fixtures/slippi/README.md) for import-only
checks), drive the actual native `Match::step` to produce expected
observations, embed those same observations back into the file, and then run
`validate-replay` against it. Corrupting any recorded field or controller
input is asserted to produce a first-divergence failure at that exact frame.

**Proves:** the file-backed comparison harness itself works — timeline
selection, checkpoint restoration, input conversion, the observation policy's
field-by-field comparison and first-divergence reporting all function
correctly, including their many optional-profile and version-gated branches.

**Does not prove:** anything about Melee. The "expected" observations came
from the same native implementation being tested; a bug shared between the
recording step and the comparison step is invisible to this harness by
construction. This is why `replay_match.rs`'s own doc comment calls these
"self-recorded" rather than "parity" regressions, and why `make-initialization`
and `validate-replay`'s docs describe them the same way.

## 3. Real-replay comparison with the ratchet

`crates/cli/tests/real_parity.rs` compares the native match — initialized from
an independently produced gameplay export via `make-initialization` — against
[`tests/fixtures/slippi/parity/fox-fd.slp`](../tests/fixtures/slippi/parity/manifest.json),
a real, human-played Fox-vs-Fox Final Destination recording from the CC0-1.0
`erickfm/slippi-public-dataset-v3.7` corpus. Neither the replay nor the
gameplay export's resources come from Skirmish's own simulator.

**Proves:** for however many frames the report's `first_divergent_frame`
reaches (or fully, if `matched`), the native simulation's observable fields
agree with an authentic recording, for this one matchup and stage. The test
ratchets that frame against a recorded baseline
(`tests/fixtures/slippi/parity/fox-fd-baseline.json`), so a code change that
makes agreement *worse* is a failure, not just a number that quietly
regresses.

**Does not prove:** agreement for any other matchup, stage, or input pattern
than what this one recording happens to exercise; agreement beyond the
selected observation fields (`docs/replays.md`'s `fighter-post-v11` policy
excludes RNG, collision-line geometry, items and more); or agreement once the
first divergence is reached — the report's `checked_frames` is a matched
*prefix*, not a summary of the whole file. It is also gated on real data:
without `SKIRMISH_GAMEPLAY_DATA` (see `docs/gameplay-export.md`) this test
skips, and a skip is not evidence of anything.

**Current measurement (2026-09-11, gameplay export v5,
`/mnt/archive/datasets/melee/skirmish-gameplay/v5-snapshot-20260911`, after
the real-replay parity loop's Dash/Turn `action_frame` batches):** 116
frames match (-123 through -8) and the first divergent frame is -7, field
`position.x` (expected `-17.7748`, actual `-17.6948`, on P1's Run->KneeBend
transition, with `action_state` itself already matching).

**Diagnosis (not a Skirmish bug -- a pack data gap, reported per this loop's
own stop condition):** frame-by-frame position deltas through this
transition (`-14`..`-6`: `2.1175, 2.1175, 2.1175, 2.1175, 2.09, 2.0625,
2.035, 1.875, 1.715`) show a *constant* per-frame reduction of `0.0275`
through Run (frames `-11`..`-8`), then a *constant* reduction of `0.16`
starting exactly at the KneeBend/JumpSquat entry (`-8`->`-7` and `-7`->`-6`
alike) -- `0.16` is exactly `0.08 * 2.0`, where `0.08` is Fox's own
`movement.ground_friction` in this pack. `game::simulation::move_fighter`'s
generic grounded fallback (used by JumpSquat, Turn, Wait, Squat and every
other action `game::locomotion::ground_motion` doesn't own) already ports
`ft_80084F3C` exactly: `friction = ground_friction; if |gr_vel| >
walk_max_velocity { friction *= rules.friction_above_walk }`. Fox's
`ground_velocity` here (~1.9-2.0) is well above `walk_max_velocity` (`1.6`
in this pack), so the boost should apply -- but pack v5's (and v4's)
`rules.friction_above_walk` is `1.0`, a no-op, so Skirmish applies the
unboosted `0.08` instead of the needed `0.16`. Confirmed directly: patching
a local copy of the pack's `match-data.json` to `friction_above_walk = 2.0`
(not committed -- a throwaway diagnostic copy, deleted after use) moves
`checked_frames` from 116 to 120 with no other change, isolating this as
the sole cause of the -7 divergence. The next divergence with that patch
applied is frame -3, field `action_age` (expected a non-integer `3.01`,
actual `1.0`) -- a different, downstream matter (a tracked float animation
frame during KneeBend/Jump, not yet investigated) that this diagnostic
patch was not meant to resolve. `rules.friction_above_walk` is a single
match-wide constant (`src/game/data.rs`), matching `ftCommonData` being
shared across every character, so a single corrected value should apply
universally once re-exported; this needs a live-pack data fix (the
gameplay-export pipeline, not this repository) rather than a Skirmish code
change, so it is reported here rather than chased further.

Previously (2026-09-11, gameplay export v5, after the real-replay parity
loop's Dash->Run `action_frame` timing fix): 116 frames matched
(-123 through -8) and the first divergent frame was -7, `position.x`, as
above -- unchanged by the subsequent entry-time consolidation batch
(`docs/validation.md`), confirmed by re-measuring rather than assumed.

Previously (2026-09-11, gameplay export v5, the real-replay parity loop's
Dash->Run `action_frame` timing fix): 116 frames matched (-123 through -8),
up from 110. Pack v5 publishes `move_id` for the specials that pack v4 was
missing (`docs/ecb-load-flags.md`'s "Known gap" no longer blocks stepping
this match through its own recorded inputs past frame ~71); it is otherwise
identical to v4 for this fox-fd data through the range measured here. The
previous divergence (-13, `action_state`
on a Dash->Run transition, described below) is fixed: `game::dash::
update_dash_or_run`'s and `game::locomotion`'s Dash-to-Run check compared
`action_frame >= dash_run_frame`, one frame later than `fn_800CA5F0`'s own
`cur_anim_frame >= dash_run_frame` (the animation's scripted run flag,
`ftaction.c:462`) -- the generic per-frame animation advance
(`Fighter_Spaghetti_8006AD10`'s `ftAnim_8006EBA4`, `fighter.c:1684`) already
bumps decomp's `cur_anim_frame` for the current frame before `ftCo_Dash_IASA`
reads it, while `simulation::advance`'s shared end-of-frame `action_frame +=
1` has not yet run at the point this check reads `action_frame`. Both copies
of the check now compare `action_frame + 1 >= dash_run_frame`, confirmed
directly against `fox-fd.slp`: P1 holds forward through Dash frames -24..-14
(`action_age` 1..11) and is already in Run at -13, one frame before the
unadjusted comparison produced. The new divergence at -7 is a separate,
unrelated subsystem (Run's ground movement or the KneeBend/JumpSquat entry
itself, not the Dash-to-Run transition), reported rather than chased in this
batch.

Previously (2026-09-11, gameplay export v4,
`/mnt/archive/datasets/melee/skirmish-gameplay/v4-snapshot-20260911`, the
real-replay parity loop's Dash->Turn `action_age` fix): 110 frames match
(-123 through -14) and the first divergent frame is -13, field
`action_state` (expected `0x0015`/Run, actual `0x0014`/Dash, on P1's
Dash->Run transition). The previous divergence (-30, `action_age` on a
Dash->Turn transition, described below) is fixed: `ftCo_Turn_Enter`/
`ftCo_Turn_Enter_Smash` (`ftCo_Turn.c:49-62`, `:173-188`) call `ftAnim_
8006EBA4(gobj)` immediately after `Fighter_ChangeMotionState`, the same
extra animation advance `ftCo_Dash_Enter` already made -- so `Action::Turn`
needed the same `action_frame`-unadjusted treatment `observation::observe`
already gave `Action::Dash`, confirmed directly against `fox-fd.slp`'s
dash-dance rally (P1 re-enters Turn at both -30 and -25, each already
reporting `state_age = 1.0`). `ftCo_TurnRun_Enter` (`ftCo_TurnRun.c:44-51`)
changes motion state but does not make this extra call, so `Action::RunTurn`
is unaffected. The new divergence at -13 is a separate, unrelated subsystem
(the Dash-to-Run transition frame itself), reported rather than chased in
this batch. A missing `move_id` in the v4 pack (unrelated to either fix)
blocks stepping this same match past frame ~71 through its own recorded
inputs, which is why the jump landing at frames 418-421 could only be
confirmed against the recording's own ground truth, not against Skirmish's
simulated value there (`docs/ecb-load-flags.md`'s "Known gap").

Previously (2026-09-11, gameplay export v4,
`/mnt/archive/datasets/melee/skirmish-gameplay/v4-snapshot-20260911`, the
ECB-load-flags batch, `docs/ecb-load-flags.md`): 93 frames match
(-123 through -31) and the first divergent frame is -30, field
`action_age` (expected 1, actual 0, on P1's Dash -> Turn transition). This
measurement used the v4 pack directly rather than `SKIRMISH_GAMEPLAY_DATA`
(unset in ordinary CI; the ratchet below still applies once v4 or later is
published there). The previous divergence (-50/-49, `action_state` Fall
vs. Landing, described below) is fixed: `game::collision::sample` now
passes `load_joints` the flags the decomp's own collision entry point uses
per path (6 airborne, 5 grounded) instead of one static, always-0 resource
field, and `game::collision::resolve`'s floor-contact branch now rests
`position` itself on the floor (instead of `position + ecb.current.bottom`)
whenever the raw airborne ECB bottom samples above position, matching
`mpColl_80046904`'s `ecb_unlocked`/`ignore_bottom`. The entry fall
(-52..-49) now matches the recording bit-for-bit, including the landing
position (`0.0001`). The new divergence at -30 is a separate, unrelated
subsystem (action/turn-state age tracking) and is reported rather than
chased in this batch. A missing `move_id` in the v4 pack (unrelated to
collision) blocks stepping this same match past frame ~71 through its own
recorded inputs, which is why the jump landing at frames 418-421 could only
be confirmed against the recording's own ground truth, not against
Skirmish's simulated value there (`docs/ecb-load-flags.md`'s "Known gap").

Previously (2026-09-11, gameplay export v4, private dataset
`cornerian/skirmish-datapacks`, pinned by
`tests/fixtures/slippi/parity/gameplay-export.lock.json`): 73 frames
match (-123 through -51) and the first divergent frame is -50, field
`action_state` (expected Fall, actual Landing). Pack v4 corrects the
collision-box and hurtbox bones: the game indexes its joint array
directly for those (`ft_081B.c:52-57`, `ftcoll.c:3231-3285`) and only
routes hitbox bones through the parts table (`ftaction.c:315`), so Fox's
collision box samples joints `[41, 55, 25, 13, 7, 4]`, not the root. The
remaining frame was the loader's two-unit padding: the game's ordinary
airborne and grounded loads pass flag bit 4 and skip it
(`mpcoll.c:392-397`, entry points at 2741-2835 and 3999-4034), while
Skirmish applied one static flag of zero; fixed above.

Previously (2026-09-11, gameplay export v3, private dataset
`cornerian/skirmish-datapacks`, pinned by
`tests/fixtures/slippi/parity/gameplay-export.lock.json`): 72 frames
match (-123 through -52) and the first divergent frame is -51, field
`action_state` (expected Fall, actual Landing). The v3 pack is the complete
Fox on Final Destination export: every fighter profile, the three Fox
specials, per-frame poses for every movement state, and all rule sets.
The divergence is not a data limitation: every landing in the recording
(the entry fall at -52..-49, jump landings at 418-421, 739-742, 1344-1347,
the Illusion landing at 654-657) shows the position 2.7 to 3.6 units
below the floor for one airborne frame before Landing at 0.0001, so the
game detects the floor one frame after the position crosses it, while
Skirmish lands on the crossing frame. That ordering inside the airborne
collision solver is the next batch (`docs/landing-order.md` when it
lands). The ECB-timing batch's earlier conclusion that Fox's collision
bottom equalling the position makes this unfixable is superseded by that
evidence; its ten-frame ECB lock fix stands (`docs/ecb-timing.md`).

Previously (2026-09-11, gameplay export v2, private dataset
`cornerian/skirmish-datapacks`, pinned by
`tests/fixtures/slippi/parity/gameplay-export.lock.json`):** 72 frames
match (-123 through -52: the Entry warp-in of both ports, the input lock,
the dead flag, and P1's EntryEnd->Fall handoff at -59 with the corrected
0-based `state_age`), and the first divergent frame is still -51, field
`action_state` (expected `0x001d`/Fall, actual `0x002a`/Landing) --
unchanged by the movement-poses batch (`docs/movement-poses.md`).

That batch spliced the v2 pack's `movement_poses` into a local copy of
`fox-fd/match-data.json` (`/mnt/shared/tmp/skirmish-gameplay-v2-poses/`,
not committed; `fox-fd-baseline.json` is untouched, since the published
snapshot lacks the poses) and re-ran `make-initialization`/
`validate-replay`: the frame and field are identical to the prior
measurement below. `docs/movement-poses.md` explains why: Fox's exported
`collision_box.indices` includes the skeleton's root joint (translation
`[0.0; 3]` in every pose by this dataset's own TransN-stripping
convention), which pins his ECB bottom to exactly `position.y` regardless
of animation, so no per-frame pose -- however it tucks the other five
joints -- can move his landing frame. This is a limitation of that
dataset's `collision_box.indices` (from the earlier, separately-pinned ECB
batch), not of the movement-poses wiring itself, which `tests/
game_movement_poses.rs`'s synthetic (non-root-sampling) fixture confirms
works as designed. The recording's own state-age reset at -51 (Fall's
9-sample pose looping over an 8-frame period, not a discrete
`Fighter_ChangeMotionState` re-entry) is diagnosed and reproduced
(`game::movement::loop_period`, `crates/skirmish-replay/src/
observation.rs`'s matching `action_age` branch) but does not itself affect
ground-contact timing. The v2 pack carries Fox's locomotion, idle,
escapes, air dodge, grab, dash attack, tilts, smashes, jab combo, aerials,
shield, ledge, nudge and movement-pose profiles plus the match rules; the
remaining profiles are being exported. The baseline file records the
matched-frame count and must move forward as divergences are fixed; this
one needs a `collision_box.indices` revisit, not a poses change, to move.

Previously (2026-09-11, before the movement-poses batch): the same 72
frames matched and the same frame/field diverged (-51, `action_state`,
Fall vs. Landing) -- recorded here as "a new, separate divergence that
this batch did not diagnose"; the movement-poses batch above is the
diagnosis.

Previously (before the `state_age`/`action_age` transition-frame fix,
`docs/validation.md`): 64 frames matched (-123 through -60), and the first
divergent frame was -59, where P1 leaves EntryEnd for Fall: Skirmish
reported the new action's age as 1 on that frame while the recording
reported 0.

## Practical consequence

None of these three, individually or together, is "Skirmish matches Melee."
Level 1 rules out a class of arithmetic bugs in ported functions. Level 2
guards the test harness against regressing on itself. Level 3 is the only one
that touches an independent recording, and even it is scoped to one matchup,
one stage, and a fixed field set. Treat a "matched" `real_parity` result as
"no evidence of disagreement was found in what was checked," not as a
certification.
