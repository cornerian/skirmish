# Three levels of "does this match Melee", and what each does not prove

Skirmish's test suite makes three distinct claims about agreement with the
original game. They are easy to conflate because all three involve comparing
Rust output against something external; keeping them separate matters because
each one only rules out a specific kind of bug.

## 1. Function-level C-oracle equivalence

`tests/*_differential.rs` (run with `cargo test --features c-oracle`) compile
small, content-hashed snapshots of the pinned decomp's own C (`tests/oracle`)
and compare a Rust function's output against that compiled C, bit for bit,
over generated and boundary inputs.

**Proves:** a specific Rust function reproduces a specific original C
function's arithmetic, including edge cases (NaN, signed zero, boundary
thresholds), given the same inputs.

**Does not prove:** that the function is called correctly, in the right order,
with the right inputs, as part of a whole action or frame; that unported
neighboring logic doesn't change the outcome; or anything about PowerPC/GameCube
floating-point behavior beyond what host C shares with it. See `AGENTS.md`:
"Host C agreement does not establish PowerPC or whole-game equivalence."

## 2. Self-recorded replay regression

`crates/cli/tests/replay_match.rs`, `crates/peppi-adapter/tests/replays.rs`
and `crates/cli/tests/slippi_corpus.rs` write synthetic `.slp` files (or use
[ten archived real files](../tests/fixtures/slippi/README.md) for import-only
checks), drive the actual native `Match::step` to produce expected
observations, embed those same observations back into the file, and then run
`validate-replay` against it. Corrupting any recorded field or controller
input is asserted to produce a first-divergence failure at that exact frame.

**Proves:** the file-backed comparison harness itself works — timeline
selection, checkpoint restoration, input conversion, the observation policy's
field-by-field comparison and first-divergence reporting all function
correctly, including their many optional-profile and version-gated branches.

**Does not prove:** anything about Melee. The "expected" observations came
from the same native implementation being tested; a bug shared between the
recording step and the comparison step is invisible to this harness by
construction. This is why `replay_match.rs`'s own doc comment calls these
"self-recorded" rather than "parity" regressions, and why `make-initialization`
and `validate-replay`'s docs describe them the same way.

## 3. Real-replay comparison with the ratchet

`crates/cli/tests/real_parity.rs` compares the native match — initialized from
an independently produced gameplay export via `make-initialization` — against
[`tests/fixtures/slippi/parity/fox-fd.slp`](../tests/fixtures/slippi/parity/manifest.json),
a real, human-played Fox-vs-Fox Final Destination recording from the CC0-1.0
`erickfm/slippi-public-dataset-v3.7` corpus. Neither the replay nor the
gameplay export's resources come from Skirmish's own simulator.

**Proves:** for however many frames the report's `first_divergent_frame`
reaches (or fully, if `matched`), the native simulation's observable fields
agree with an authentic recording, for this one matchup and stage. The test
ratchets that frame against a recorded baseline
(`tests/fixtures/slippi/parity/fox-fd-baseline.json`), so a code change that
makes agreement *worse* is a failure, not just a number that quietly
regresses.

**Does not prove:** agreement for any other matchup, stage, or input pattern
than what this one recording happens to exercise; agreement beyond the
selected observation fields (`docs/replays.md`'s `fighter-post-v11` policy
excludes RNG, collision-line geometry, items and more); or agreement once the
first divergence is reached — the report's `checked_frames` is a matched
*prefix*, not a summary of the whole file. It is also gated on real data:
without `SKIRMISH_GAMEPLAY_DATA` (see `docs/gameplay-export.md`) this test
skips, and a skip is not evidence of anything.

**Current measurement (2026-09-11, gameplay export v4, private dataset
`cornerian/skirmish-datapacks`, pinned by
`tests/fixtures/slippi/parity/gameplay-export.lock.json`):** 73 frames
match (-123 through -51) and the first divergent frame is -50, field
`action_state` (expected Fall, actual Landing). Pack v4 corrects the
collision-box and hurtbox bones: the game indexes its joint array
directly for those (`ft_081B.c:52-57`, `ftcoll.c:3231-3285`) and only
routes hitbox bones through the parts table (`ftaction.c:315`), so Fox's
collision box samples joints `[41, 55, 25, 13, 7, 4]`, not the root. The
remaining frame is the loader's two-unit padding: the game's ordinary
airborne and grounded loads pass flag bit 4 and skip it
(`mpcoll.c:392-397`, entry points at 2741-2835 and 3999-4034), while
Skirmish applies one static flag of zero; that is the next batch
(`docs/ecb-load-flags.md`).

Previously (2026-09-11, gameplay export v2, private dataset
`cornerian/skirmish-datapacks`, pinned by
`tests/fixtures/slippi/parity/gameplay-export.lock.json`):** 72 frames
match (-123 through -52: the Entry warp-in of both ports, the input lock,
the dead flag, and P1's EntryEnd->Fall handoff at -59 with the corrected
0-based `state_age`), and the first divergent frame is still -51, field
`action_state` (expected `0x001d`/Fall, actual `0x002a`/Landing) --
unchanged by the movement-poses batch (`docs/movement-poses.md`).

That batch spliced the v2 pack's `movement_poses` into a local copy of
`fox-fd/match-data.json` (`/mnt/shared/tmp/skirmish-gameplay-v2-poses/`,
not committed; `fox-fd-baseline.json` is untouched, since the published
snapshot lacks the poses) and re-ran `make-initialization`/
`validate-replay`: the frame and field are identical to the prior
measurement below. `docs/movement-poses.md` explains why: Fox's exported
`collision_box.indices` includes the skeleton's root joint (translation
`[0.0; 3]` in every pose by this dataset's own TransN-stripping
convention), which pins his ECB bottom to exactly `position.y` regardless
of animation, so no per-frame pose -- however it tucks the other five
joints -- can move his landing frame. This is a limitation of that
dataset's `collision_box.indices` (from the earlier, separately-pinned ECB
batch), not of the movement-poses wiring itself, which `tests/
game_movement_poses.rs`'s synthetic (non-root-sampling) fixture confirms
works as designed. The recording's own state-age reset at -51 (Fall's
9-sample pose looping over an 8-frame period, not a discrete
`Fighter_ChangeMotionState` re-entry) is diagnosed and reproduced
(`game::movement::loop_period`, `crates/skirmish-replay/src/
observation.rs`'s matching `action_age` branch) but does not itself affect
ground-contact timing. The v2 pack carries Fox's locomotion, idle,
escapes, air dodge, grab, dash attack, tilts, smashes, jab combo, aerials,
shield, ledge, nudge and movement-pose profiles plus the match rules; the
remaining profiles are being exported. The baseline file records the
matched-frame count and must move forward as divergences are fixed; this
one needs a `collision_box.indices` revisit, not a poses change, to move.

Previously (2026-09-11, before the movement-poses batch): the same 72
frames matched and the same frame/field diverged (-51, `action_state`,
Fall vs. Landing) -- recorded here as "a new, separate divergence that
this batch did not diagnose"; the movement-poses batch above is the
diagnosis.

Previously (before the `state_age`/`action_age` transition-frame fix,
`docs/validation.md`): 64 frames matched (-123 through -60), and the first
divergent frame was -59, where P1 leaves EntryEnd for Fall: Skirmish
reported the new action's age as 1 on that frame while the recording
reported 0.

## Practical consequence

None of these three, individually or together, is "Skirmish matches Melee."
Level 1 rules out a class of arithmetic bugs in ported functions. Level 2
guards the test harness against regressing on itself. Level 3 is the only one
that touches an independent recording, and even it is scoped to one matchup,
one stage, and a fixed field set. Treat a "matched" `real_parity` result as
"no evidence of disagreement was found in what was checked," not as a
certification.
